# Variable Naming Rules (Identifiers)

# 1- Can Only Contain Alpha-Numeric Characters And Underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _)
# 2- Cannot Start With A Number (1-9)
# 3- Cannot Be A Reserved Word (Keywords)
# 4- Case Sensitive (My_Var Is Different From my_var)
# 5- Can Be Any Length (But Keep It Reasonable)
# 6- Cannot Contain Special Characters (!, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), -, +, =, {, }, [, ], |, \, :, ;, ", ', <, >, ,, ., ?, /)
# 7- Use Meaningful Names (Descriptive)
# 8- Use Underscores To Separate Words (my_variable_name)
# 9- Avoid Using Single Character Names (Except For Counters Or Iterators)
# 10- Follow A Consistent Naming Convention (snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase)
